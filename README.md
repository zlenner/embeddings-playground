# WTF is this?

This site lets you see how text-based AIs (like ChatGPT) understand text. You can enter two or more words, phrases or pieces of text and the site will tell you how similar or different that AI model thinks they are. It's a cool way to peek into the 'mind' of the AI imo.

Right now ~~the only model we have (text-embedding-ada-002) is actually from OpenAI and is probably very-very similar to how ChatGPT views text.~~ we have models from various companies like OpenAI, Google, Nvidia, and Voyage (yes, despite them openly cheating their way to the top of MTEB).
